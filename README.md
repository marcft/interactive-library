# Library Website

This is a simple library website project that allows users to manage their book collection. Users can easily add books, mark them as read or unread, and remove them from their library. The project is designed with a user-friendly interface and straightforward functionality.

## Features

- **Add Books**: Users can add books to their library by clicking the "Add Book" button and filling out a form with book details, including title, author, and whether they have read the book or not.

- **Mark as Read/Unread**: Users can toggle the "Read" status of each book in their library. This helps in keeping track of which books they have already read and which ones they still need to read.

- **Remove Books**: If a user decides to remove a book from their library, they can easily do so by clicking the "Remove" button associated with that book.
